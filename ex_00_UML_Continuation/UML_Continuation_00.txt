Continuation to UML

Use Case Diagrams

	4 main elemnts:

	- Use Cases: what actions an actor has access to in the program.
	- Actors: who or what (can be an API key) takes part in the actions.
	- Subsystems: normally represented with large rectangular boxes. Clusters of actions.
	- Relationships: represented by doted lines.

Deployment Diagrams

	Defines the architechture for a system
    - Nodes: everything is a node. It's the real world component.
    - Components: kind of rounded rectangle. It's the actual piece of software that manages communication and handles the business logic for the node that it resides on. 
    - Artifacts: surrounded by the angle brackets. They point to different specific systems: angular, linux. Things are going to be built a certain way because of these.
    - Links: The links are those lines that are connecting each one of the nodes. 
    - Dependencies: Dependencies are represented by that dotted line with arrows going in the direction of the node. It shows what other nodes it depends on.
    - Associations: It is a way of connecting all of the nodes and showing how they're associated.

Package Diagrams

	They carry abstract elements like: 
	- types
	- classifiers
	- other diagrams
	Your package diagram is something that allows you to take your other different components inside of your system and show how they relate to each other.
