# Lifecicle in React

## Mounting Process
First step of listing what we will need, what structure it's going to have. We set the environment and get the modules needed.

## Updating
We update and change everything needed. One of the big pros of react is that components are separated and thus it's very easy to identify what gets outdated.

## Unmounting
Decoupling components that aren't used or that are redundant in the project. Also easy because they are separate elements.
