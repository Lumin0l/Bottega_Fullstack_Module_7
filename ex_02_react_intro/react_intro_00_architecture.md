# Architecture of React

Many people will call it a "framework" because it's very powerful, but in reality it's a JS Library.

It is component based, unlike Django. Every element (buttoms, thumbnails...) is a component and they are reusable. With this, instead of having many html templates, we only get 1  html file with all the separate components, but those components only get rendered if and when they are called by the app.
