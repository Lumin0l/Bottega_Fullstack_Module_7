# Technologies, elements and plugins that make React happen

## Webpack

Here we can find our configuration files, the files where the instructions on how the React app will work are set up.
Normally this needs to be done by hand, but in our project it is included by the teacher and his npm module.

## Babel

Contained within .babelrc: a **hidden file**[^1] that acts as a configuration file for babel.
It is a **JS Compiler**. It compiles the code into code that the browsers can read, so we can use more tools than usual.

## Axios
Axios is a npm library that allows us to call APIs and render the data in our app.


[^1]: hidden files are those followed by a "." -> .gitignore, .babelrc...
